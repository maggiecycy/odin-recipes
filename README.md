# Odin Recipes

This is a simple project from **The Odin Project** that focuses on building a basic recipe website using **HTML**.

## 📝 Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a small website that contains links to different recipe pages. Each page will include the recipe’s title, image, ingredients, and steps.  
This project helps reinforce my understanding of basic **HTML structure**, **links**, **lists**, and **images**.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have:
- Practiced writing clean and semantic HTML
- Learned how to structure a multi-page website
- Used relative paths to link between pages
- Improved my ability to organize project files logically

## 📚 Reflection (optional)
After finishing this project, I realized how important proper file structure and consistent formatting are for readability. It was also a good review of how to use lists, images, and links effectively in HTML.
